# My first two weeks at Awesome Inc

It's hard to believe that within just two short weeks I have learned so much and the days
of prework seem ages away. I came into the bootcamp with a minimal knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and a little bit of bootstrap. In just our first week we covered an abundance of topics:

* Refining our understanding of Git and Github

* Integrating tools for streamlining our work Ex. Sass, Bootstrap, browser-sync etc..

* We created and merged our first pull requests

* Daily exposure to Javascript through warm-ups

* Learning how to learn

With all of these new things being introduced in the first week, my head was spinning! My old routine of going to work and being the expert in what I do had changed, I was a student again. It was a little overwhelming at times, but the reward of learning something new every day and looking forward to what lies in the future outweighs any self-doubt or insecurity **by far**. My biggest challenge will be maintaining enough self discipline to manage my time outside of class and use as much free time as I can to learn more.

During week two we dove straight into Javascript and started our first project using Javascript. This is where things started to get a little scary for me, it helped me identify the areas that I really needed to work on. Some things I feel I was deficient in:

* My ability to communicate effectively in pair programming

* My grasp on using the bootstrap grid system for styling

* My understanding of functions and function calls in Javascript
