# Week four of classes, wrestling with Javascript and Vue.js

Four the past couple of weeks since my last blog post, we have really be getting
more in depth with Javascript and the more logical though processes required for
making a reactive web page. Wow it has been a wild ride! When we started the bootcamp
and they told us it would be an emotional rollercoaster, they were spot on. Some days
it feels like I am learning things so quickly and I'm itching to test out my new skills
on an independent project, then when I'm finally sitting there with earbuds in
ready to code it seems like I blank out and forget everything. I cant help but get frustrated
sometimes, I hope that as we keep practicing I'm able to connect the dots easier.

This week we are going to start discussing our final projects which is very exciting,
I have so many ideas! One idea that appeals to me the most is an application where
people can sign up and create a group of tasks or chores that they need to be completed.
They can add other users to their task group and delegate the tasks to each member of said
group. Then each member can check off the tasks as they get them completed! This is just
rough overview so I'm not completed sure what it would entail. I think there is plenty
of room to think of new cool features I could add though as I learn more.
