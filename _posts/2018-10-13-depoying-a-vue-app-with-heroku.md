## Deploying a vue.js app made with the Vue CLI to Heroku

    So I had some issues yesterday with deploying an app to Heroku that I made with
  the Vue cli. It was only my second time deploying anything to Heroku on my own, and
  after I followed all the steps for deploying the app, I tried to view it on [&lt;Heroku&gt;](https://christinas-vuejscalc.herokuapp.com/) but all it got was a blank page with only
  a message that said /CANNOT GET on the top left.

  After extensive trouble shooting and googling for almost thirty minutes, I found [&lt;this&gt;](https://medium.com/netscape/deploying-a-vue-js-2-x-app-to-heroku-in-5-steps-tutorial-a69845ace489) article which finally helped me to solve the issue. If I have this issue again in the future,
  I'm making a note to myself to look back here for resolving it.
